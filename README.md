# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction  

This project was completed as part of my **CodSoft Data Science Internship (Task 1)**.  
The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

## 📊 Project Overview  
The Titanic dataset is a classic beginner-friendly dataset in data science and machine learning.  
In this project, I:  
- Performed **data cleaning & preprocessing**  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations  
- Built a **classification model** to predict survival  
- Evaluated the model’s accuracy and performance

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Google Colab** – Notebook environment  
- **pandas, numpy** – Data manipulation  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** – Machine learning models

## 📈 Key Insights  
- **Gender & Class:** Females and passengers in higher classes had a higher chance of survival.  
- **Age:** Children had higher survival rates compared to adults.  
- **Fare:** Higher ticket fare correlated with higher chances of survival.
